# 🚀  Kutloano — The Developer in Motion

Most people step into tech. I stumbled into it, half curious and half determined, and realized quickly that I wasn’t just learning how to code. I was learning how to build worlds from scratch. This GitHub is where I document that journey: the experiments, the wins, the back to the drawing board moments, and everything in between.

## ⚡ Who I Am

I'm Kutloano, a Web Developer in training, an AI explorer, and someone who genuinely enjoys figuring things out. I don’t pretend to know everything, but I’m relentless about learning what I don’t.

Quick snapshot:

- Matric graduate plus FNB App Academy certificate
- Comfortable in HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Python, Git, and AWS
- Speak English, Afrikaans, Zulu, and Sepedi
- Strengths include precision, curiosity, problem solving, and creativity
- Currently exploring AWS, deeper JavaScript theory, and AI concepts

##  🧰 Tech & Tools I Use

- Languages include HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Python.
- Cloud experience includes AWS with S3, CloudFront, EC2 basics, and VPC basics.
- Environments include Linux, VS Code, Git, and GitHub.

I don’t chase tools for the sake of it. I pick the ones that help me build better, smarter, cleaner systems.

##   🎢  Projects That Shaped My Journey

### 🍽️ Embers & Co Static Restaurant Website

This is where I learned that a simple website can solve real business problems. It is deployed on AWS S3 and built for clarity and speed.

### 📚  TEFL Study Notes

A small but growing archive of my learning, including teaching theories, classroom management insights, and language fundamentals.

### 🧪 AWS Labs & Notes

Hands on deep dives into AWS services. Less theory, more break it, fix it, learn it.

## 🎯 What I’m Building Toward

I’m pushing myself toward becoming a well rounded developer who understands not just how things work, but why they work. My current focus areas include:

- Stronger JavaScript foundations
- Cloud hosted web applications
- Core AI fundamentals

This profile is the evolving footprint of that journey.
